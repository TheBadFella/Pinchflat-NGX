### Sources

- **Single video sources:** Add one-off YouTube video URLs directly instead of treating everything as a channel or
  playlist.
- **Selective playlist downloads:** Index a playlist, review its items, and choose exactly what to fetch from the
  Selection flow.
- **Stronger source controls:** See automatic and delayed sources at a glance, with inline and menu actions to start,
  pause, or stop them.
- **Faster source actions:** Jump to a source from notifications and delete sources directly from their management views.
- **Per-source folder routing:** Send each source to its own folder with a picker for existing directories and
  template-aware output paths.

### Interface

- **Material 3 AMOLED theme:** Dark, consistent surfaces with shared semantic colors, spacing, controls, and hierarchy.
- **Native Tailwind v4 pipeline:** Theme tokens and the native Tailwind v4 asset pipeline keep the interface consistent
  and maintainable.
- **Cleaner forms:** Refined toggles, custom selects, clearer editing states, and better guidance when creating sources
  and profiles.
- **Collapsible sidebar:** Collapse desktop navigation when you want a denser workspace.
- **Mobile polish:** Source, job, history, profile, and settings views adapt cleanly to smaller screens.
- **Settings search:** Filter Settings to find notifications, extractor options, cookies, and yt-dlp controls quickly.
- **Interface gallery:** Explore the [Screenshots](#screenshots) gallery below for full captures of the interface.

### Downloads

- **Cookie management:** Upload, paste, and inspect the shared `cookies.txt` file from Settings.
- **YouTube API-key testing:** Validate a key before relying on it for indexing.
- **Unavailable-media handling:** Skip and label members-only, private, or removed videos instead of retrying forever.
- **Clear media states:** The Other tab distinguishes Unavailable, Removed, Ignored, and Filtered Out items.
- **Live speed visibility:** See current download speed in the jobs dashboard and media tables.
- **Safer retries:** Retry flows clear stale errors and keep job and media state aligned.
- **Controlled yt-dlp updates:** Choose stable, nightly, frozen nightly, nightly-until-stable, or a pinned version.
- **yt-dlp base configuration:** Maintain additional yt-dlp options in Settings using familiar config-file syntax.
- **Failed-download workflow:** Review failed items on Home and retry one or many from history and source tables.
- **Cookie-aware forced retries:** Forced retries continue to apply cookies when livestream prechecks are skipped.

### Operations

- **Queue diagnostics:** Inspect running, retryable, and discarded Oban jobs; reset or cancel individual jobs; and clear
  discarded queues.
- **Worker concurrency:** Set separate limits for downloads, indexing, and metadata in Settings. Environment variables
  can override those saved values.
- **Release status:** See whether Pinchflat-ngx is current and which yt-dlp update policy is active.
- **Operational diagnostics:** Use structured source, indexing, enqueue, and skipped-download logs alongside responsive
  integrity and maintenance tools.
- **Repository-friendly Compose layout:** Development Compose files live in `docker/`, while the root `compose.yaml`
  keeps `docker compose up` working for contributors.
- **Current FFmpeg builds:** Images install FFmpeg from
  [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds) `latest`.
- **Ongoing fork improvements:** Smaller workflow, interface, and reliability changes continue to land as they prove
  useful in daily self-hosted use.

### Single sign-on

Pinchflat-ngx can protect the web interface with OAuth2/OpenID Connect. It supports provider discovery, PKCE, state and nonce
validation, configurable scopes, and fixed callback URLs for reverse-proxy deployments.

OIDC replaces Basic Auth for browser routes when enabled. Feed endpoints retain Basic Auth and route-token support for
podcast clients. General API endpoints require `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`
when Basic Auth or OIDC is enabled. API clients send these credentials using HTTP Basic Auth;
an OIDC browser session does not authorize API calls. With OIDC alone and no Basic Auth credentials,
general API requests are rejected. Unconfigured trusted-network installations retain unauthenticated access.
`/healthcheck` and `/api/spec` remain public; share intake uses its own scoped tokens.

```yaml
services:
  pinchflat-ngx:
    image: ghcr.io/thebadfella/pinchflat-ngx:latest
    environment:
      TZ: America/Regina
    ports:
      - '8945:8945'
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./downloads:/downloads
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Save this as `compose.yaml`, replace the timezone if needed, and run `docker compose up -d`. Open
<http://localhost:8945> when the container is healthy.

### Retention schedule

Set the retention period per source with **Retention Period (days)**. Files become eligible for deletion
that many days after download and are removed on the next retention run. Leave the period blank or set
it to `0` to keep media indefinitely.

`RETENTION_CRON` controls how often the retention worker runs. It defaults to `0 1 * * *` (daily at 01:00).
`RETENTION_TIMEZONE` sets its timezone and defaults to `Etc/UTC`, independently of `TZ`.
For example, to check every four hours in Berlin time:

```yaml
environment:
  TZ: Europe/Berlin
  RETENTION_CRON: '0 */4 * * *'
  RETENTION_TIMEZONE: Europe/Berlin
```

Recreate the container after changing these variables. No custom startup command or `sed` patch is needed.
Invalid or empty cron expressions and timezones cause startup to fail.

Without these settings, retention continues to run daily at 01:00 UTC, even when `TZ` is configured.
An explicit `RETENTION_TIMEZONE` follows daylight saving time where applicable.
Other scheduled jobs retain their existing UTC schedules, so retention may run after quality upgrades
or database maintenance when you change its schedule or timezone.

Automatic quality upgrades skip media already eligible for retention deletion, including media that
expires while its upgrade is queued. This prevents an upgrade from restarting an already expired
retention period before cleanup runs. Media protected from deletion remains eligible for upgrades,
and forced downloads retain their override. Successful downloads that are allowed still update the
download timestamp as before.

### PostgreSQL image

The `latest` image continues to use SQLite. To start a new installation with PostgreSQL, use the
`latest-postgres` image and set `DATABASE_URL`:

```yaml
services:
  pinchflat-ngx:
    image: ghcr.io/thebadfella/pinchflat-ngx:latest-postgres
    environment:
      DATABASE_ADAPTER: postgres
      DATABASE_URL: ecto://pinchflat-ngx:change-me@postgres/pinchflat-ngx
      TZ: America/Regina
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - '8945:8945'
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./downloads:/downloads
    restart: unless-stopped

  postgres:
    image: postgres:18-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: pinchflat-ngx
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: change-me
      POSTGRES_USER: pinchflat-ngx
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U pinchflat-ngx -d pinchflat-ngx']
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres-data:
```

The PostgreSQL image creates and migrates its own schema, but it does not copy data from an existing SQLite database.
This PostgreSQL 18 example is intended for a fresh installation. PostgreSQL 16 or earlier volumes are not
compatible with the PostgreSQL 18 server as-is; use an explicit PostgreSQL upgrade or `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`
procedure before reusing existing PostgreSQL data. Keep using `latest` for an existing SQLite installation until
you have migrated its data separately.

> [!TIP]
> The PostgreSQL image supports in-app `pg_dump` backups and retention policies via **Settings > PostgreSQL Backups**. See the [Backups and restore guide](https://github.com/TheBadFella/pinchflat-ngx/wiki/Backups-and-Restore) for backup operations and restore commands.

### Optional PO-token provider

The default compose above keeps the provider disabled. If YouTube presents SABR or authentication problems, add the
following service and environment variable to your compose file:

```yaml
services:
  pinchflat-ngx:
    environment:
      TZ: America/Regina
      POT_PROVIDER_URL: http://pot-provider:4416

  pot-provider:
    image: brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider:2.0.0
    profiles: [pot-provider]
    restart: unless-stopped
    # No ports mapping: the unauthenticated provider stays on the Compose network.
```

Start the opt-in service with `docker compose --profile pot-provider up -d`. Pinchflat-ngx images include the matching bgutil
yt-dlp plugin, and Diagnostics reports the provider's bounded `/ping` health check. See the
[official bgutil provider documentation](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider) and
[yt-dlp's PO-token guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide) for background and limitations.

### Optional local download staging

Set `DOWNLOAD_STAGING_PATH` to an absolute path inside the container when downloads should complete on a local disk
before their finished artifacts are transferred to `/downloads`. The default is disabled, so existing deployments keep
their current direct-to-library behavior. Each download receives its own directory, and the database is updated only
after the complete artifact set reaches the media root.

For a local staging disk, add a bind mount such as:

```yaml
services:
  pinchflat-ngx:
    environment:
      DOWNLOAD_STAGING_PATH: /staging
    volumes:
      - ./download-staging:/staging
```

For a NAS library with local temporary storage, mount the local staging disk separately from the NAS destination:

```yaml
services:
  pinchflat-ngx:
    environment:
      DOWNLOAD_STAGING_PATH: /staging
    volumes:
      - /fast-local-disk/pinchflat-ngx-staging:/staging
      - /mnt/nas/media:/downloads
```

Staging and the media directory may be on different filesystems. Pinchflat-ngx uses a temporary destination name and an
atomic rename after copying in that case. Staging paths must be absolute, writable, and different from the media root.
