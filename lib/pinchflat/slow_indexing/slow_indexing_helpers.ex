  Given a media source, creates (indexes) the media by creating media_items for each
  media ID in the source. Afterward, kicks off a download task for each pending media
  item belonging to the source. Returns a list of media items or changesets
  (if the media item couldn't be created).

  Indexing is slow and usually returns a list of all media data at once for record creation.
  To help with this, we use a file follower to watch the file that yt-dlp writes to
  so we can create media items as they come in. This parallelizes the process and adds
  clarity to the user experience. This has a few things to be aware of which are documented
  below in the file watcher setup method.

  YouTube channels are indexed one tab at a time (videos, shorts, streams) as separate
  yt-dlp invocations. This matters because `--break-on-existing` aborts the whole yt-dlp
  process — not just the current tab — so indexing a bare channel URL with a download
  archive would stop at the first known video and never reach the shorts or streams tabs.
  Indexing each tab separately (with an archive filtered to that tab's content type) lets
  the early-abort optimization work per-tab without starving the others.

  Additionally, in the case of a repeat index we create a download archive file that
  contains some media IDs that we've indexed in the past. Note that this archive doesn't
  contain the most recent IDs but rather a subset of IDs that are offset by some amount.
  Practically, this means that we'll re-index a small handful of media that we've recently
  indexed, but this is a good thing since it'll let us pick up on any recent changes to the
  most recent media items.

  We don't create a download archive for playlists (only channels), nor do we create one if
  the indexing was forced by the user.

  NOTE: downloads are only enqueued if the source is set to download media. Downloads are
  also enqueued for ALL pending media items, not just the ones that were indexed in this
  job run. This should ensure that any stragglers are caught if, for some reason, they
  weren't enqueued or somehow got de-queued.

  Available options:
    - `was_forced`: Whether the indexing was forced by the user
