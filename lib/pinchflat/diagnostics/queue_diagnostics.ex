  Requeues a job by ID: cancels the current job (killing its running process if
  it's executing) and enqueues a fresh copy of the same worker + args at the back
  of the queue, so any other jobs already waiting get to run first.

  This is the safe replacement for a bare cancel. A plain cancel silently drops
  the work — which is especially painful for setups running a single worker
  (`YT_DLP_WORKER_CONCURRENCY=1`), where a long slow-index holds the only slot and
  the user just wants to yield it to other jobs without losing the index entirely.

  When the target resolves to a Source or MediaItem, the new job is created through
  `Tasks.create_job_with_task/2` so it keeps its Task linkage (and is therefore
  still cancelled by the deletion cascade). Other workers fall back to a plain
  insert. The requeued job is enqueued as `available`, so Oban's `priority`,
  `scheduled_at`, then `id` ordering naturally places it behind work already in the
  queue.
